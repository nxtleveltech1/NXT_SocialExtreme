# Audience & Response Mastery Plan

I have completely restructured the plan to focus exclusively on your demand for **Detailed User Intelligence** and **Response Rate Optimization**.

## 1. Deep Audience Intelligence Module
**Goal:** Know exactly who follows you, not just how many.
- **Follower Directory:** A searchable database of your 45k+ followers.
    - **Data Enrichment:** Auto-fetch public bio, location, and job title (e.g., "Event Planner at Cape Events").
    - **Segmentation:** Auto-group users into "VIPs," "Locals (Cape Town)," "Industry Pros," and "New Leads."
    - **Churn Tracker:** See exactly *who* unfollowed you and when.
- **User Profiles:** Click any user to see a full "Dossier":
    - **Engagement Score:** How often they like/comment.
    - **Influence Rating:** Are they a micro-influencer?
    - **History:** Every past interaction with your brand.

## 2. Response Velocity Command Center
**Goal:** World-class speed and precision in handling inquiries.
- **"Speed to Lead" Dashboard:**
    - **Real-Time Ticker:** "Average Response Time: 4m 12s" (Live).
    - **SLA Alerts:** Flashing red indicators for messages older than 15 minutes.
    - **Missed Opportunity Tracker:** Value of leads lost due to slow replies.
- **Smart Inbox Features:**
    - **Auto-Routing:** AI detects "Quote" -> Routes to Sales Team. AI detects "Broken" -> Routes to Support.
    - **Contextual Sidebar:** When chatting, see the user's *entire* cross-platform history and CRM notes instantly.
    - **One-Tap Actions:** "Send Rental Rate Card," "Book Studio Slot," "Request WhatsApp Number."

## 3. Advanced Channel Management
**Goal:** Technical perfection for each connection.
- **Connection Health:** Ping latency, token expiry countdown, and API limit usage per channel.
- **Sync Diagnostics:** Detailed log of exactly what data points were pulled and when.

## Implementation Priority
I will build the **Audience Intelligence Module** first to give you immediate visibility into your followers, followed by the **Response Command Center** to optimize your team's workflow.
